# Final Project: Delivery Robots
Hi! Below please find a short guide that walks you through this project.

Our initial idea was implementation of two delivery robots that will work in conjunction in order to deliver an item to the customer and take payment.
During the pandemic period, people lacked access to certain goods due to limited mobility. The traditional delivery infrastructure adapted to new challenges by exploiting robots. Introduction of robots was not only a safe solution, but also cost effective for enterprises. 
This project was suppose to simulate the delivery of some goods by traveling to a specific point and returning to the original location. We ran into issues because having second robot following the first one is not as simple as we thought. Therefore, our project turned into developing an algorithm that would allow the second robot to follow the first.
Two robots are used in the project. Where the second robot has to follow the path of the first robot. There is no predetermined path in the second robot.
